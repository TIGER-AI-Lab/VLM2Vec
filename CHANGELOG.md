- Release the raw video files [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMEB_Raw_Video). Please note that raw videos are not required for MMEB evaluation â€” video frames are all you need. We provide the raw videos only in case they are useful for your own purposes. Please refer to our [main data repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMEB-V2) for more instructions.
